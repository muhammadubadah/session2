To estimate the first derivative of the given function using centered differences,
backward differences, and forward differences, you can use the following formulas:

Centered differences:

f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)

Backward differences:

f'(x) ≈ (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h

Forward differences:

f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h

To compute the derivative at x = 0.5 using progressively smaller values of h,
you can use a loop to iterate over the range of h values and compute the derivative at each iteration.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%CODE RESULT%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This code will compute the derivative using each of the three methods for progressively smaller values of h,
until h becomes smaller than the machine epsilon. The results will be printed to the command window in a table,
with the step size h and the error for each method.

As the step size is reduced, you will see that the error for each method decreases,
but eventually round-off errors become dominant and the error starts to increase.
